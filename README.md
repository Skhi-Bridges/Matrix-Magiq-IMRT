# Immortality Chain (IMRT)

## Project Overview

Immortality Chain serves as the core coordination layer for the Matrix-Magiq ecosystem, implementing JAM (Justified Atomic Merkleization) with quantum-resistant security features. It provides the infrastructure for secure cross-chain communication and data integrity.

## Technical Details

This project is part of the Matrix-Magiq ecosystem, which aims to solve global food security challenges through blockchain technology with quantum resistance. The Matrix-Magiq ecosystem consists of five core components that work together:

1. **Nourish Chain (NRSH)**: Parachain focused on spirulina cultivation tracking with registry, oracle, and telemetry pallets.
2. **Elixir Chain (ELXR)**: Parachain focused on kombucha fermentation tracking, mirroring NRSH's structure with appropriate differences.
3. **Immortality Chain (IMRT)**: Core coordination layer implementing JAM (Justified Atomic Merkleization) with QValidator components.
4. **Liquidity Pallet**: Unified liquidity solution across all chains.
5. **EigenLayer Implementation**: Security layer providing validator coordination across chains.

## Focus Areas

- Quantum-resistant security protocols
- Cross-chain coordination
- Justified Atomic Merkleization (JAM)
- ActorX fill and kill operations with quantum keys

## Key Components

- **QValidator framework**: Core validation logic
- **QValidator-JAM**: For Joint Authentication Mechanism
- **QValidator-JAM-Authorizer**: For authorization
- **QValidator-JAM-Client**: For client implementation
- **QValidator-Actorx**: For fill and kill quantum keyed operations

## Comprehensive Error Correction

This component implements error correction at three critical levels:

1. **Classical Error Correction**: Using Reed-Solomon codes for traditional computing operations
2. **Bridge Error Correction**: For classical-quantum interfaces
3. **Quantum Error Correction**: Using Surface codes to protect quantum states

## Grant Request

We are requesting funding to continue development of this critical blockchain infrastructure that addresses global food security challenges. The funds will be used for:
